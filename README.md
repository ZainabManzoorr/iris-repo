Iris Dataset
Overview
The Iris dataset is one of the most well-known and widely used datasets in machine learning and statistics. It was introduced by the British statistician Ronald A. Fisher in 1936 in his paper The use of multiple measurements in taxonomic problems. The dataset is often used for classification tasks and is ideal for beginners.

The dataset consists of 150 samples of flowers, with measurements of their physical features, and is divided equally among three species of Iris:

Iris-setosa
Iris-versicolor
Iris-virginica
